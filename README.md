ABSTRACT:

Hundreds of genes have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous studies have indicated that 
some phenotypes caused by decreased developmental function of select risk genes can be reversed by restoring gene 
function in adulthood. However, very few risk genes have been assessed for adult reversibility. We developed a strategy 
to rapidly assess the temporal requirements and phenotypic reversibility of neurodevelopmental disorder risk gene 
orthologs using a conditional protein degradation system and machine vision phenotypic profiling in Caenorhabditis elegans. 
Using this approach, we measured the effects of degrading and re- expressing orthologs of 3 neurodevelopmental risk 
genes EBF3, BRN3A, and DYNC1H1 across 30 morphological, locomotor, sensory, and learning phenotypes at multiple 
timepoints throughout development. We found some degree of phenotypic reversibility was possible for each gene studied. 
However, the temporal requirements of gene function and degree of phenotypic reversibility varied by gene and phenotype. 
The data reflects the dynamic nature of gene function and the importance of using multiple time windows of degradation 
and re-expression to understand the many roles a gene can play over developmental time. This work also demonstrates a 
strategy of using a high-throughput model system to investigate temporal requirements of gene function across a large 
number of phenotypes to rapidly prioritize neurodevelopmental disorder genes for re-expression studies in other organisms.
